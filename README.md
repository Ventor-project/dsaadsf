Karlsend is the reference full node Karlsen implementation written in Go (golang).

## What is Karlsen

Karlsen is a fork of Kaspa with an ASIC resistance implementation
Kaspa is an attempt at a proof-of-work cryptocurrency with instant confirmations and sub-second block times. It is based on [the PHANTOM protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf), a generalization of Nakamoto consensus.

## Requirements
